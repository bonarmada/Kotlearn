## Kotlearn ##

This is a simple android application that is written in kotlin using dependency injection and reactive programming. 
The main libraries used are: dagger2, rxjava2, retrofit. realm for persistence.

My end goal is to rewrite all my projects into kotlin, as well as the future projects that I will be developing and obviously this will be the starting point.
 

When I want to learn something I usually do a smaller task break down.
* Learning the language
  * Learn the basic syntax and semantics of the language.
  * Basically recreate existing solutions into the project.
  * Kotlin still has a relatively small community so I pretty much have to rely on the IDE's code generation from java (it's awesome)
  and make sure that I will have to re-read the [docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) 
  * Koltin coroutines
* MVVM architectural pattern
  * For maintainability and testability.
  * Take advantage of android architecture components.
* Creating a mini app.
  * I have prepared an API and will implement the login and registration module
  * A simple app that is capable to display and manipulate data using repository pattern (local and remote data source).
* Create a working, usable app (can be ecommerce, restaurant app or something. I might use firebase db this time)
